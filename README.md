Text Machine: Scripts and models for the Conversational Intelligence Challenge are stored here.

A series of mini-projects lumped together under the ConvAI challenge. Contained in this directory
are autoencoders, neural chat models, convai production code, a non-working neural QA model, and an
MNIST GAN model.

The gemtk toolkit package is also under development here, and is being used to create other models.
